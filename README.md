# AgeGender Detector
AgeGender Detector is a Python-based application that uses deep learning to detect faces and estimate age range and gender in real-time from webcam input. It leverages OpenCVâ€™s DNN module and pre-trained Caffe models for basic facial analysis. While effective, prediction accuracy may vary due to limitations of the model and dataset.
